### Background
Hello! My name is Katie Kim and I am a third year undergraduate student at UCSD studying Math-CS.
I was born in Korea, but I grew up in Irvine. I love watching early 2000s movies, the Office, and
modern family. I love going on night walks and playing Sudoku in my free time.

This is a classic Office clip I will never stop loving: [Fire Drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO8N3L_aERg)

### My Programming Beginnings
I started coding in **high school**, where I started off with Python in 11th and Java in 12th grade.
I decided to enter UCSD as a *Math-CS* major though, because I have always had an interest in math,
~~sorta~~, so I thought it would be a nice medium to delve into. With my father being a *Systems Analyst*, 
although he doesn't have a big coding background he still **_lives_ in front of his computer for work**, 
and as someone who have always looked up to him, I knew I wanted to be in tech in some way.

### Favorite Languages
After three years of studying here, I would say my top comfortable languages are:
1. ***Java***
2. ***C++***

just because I lack expertise in the other languages. I hope to learn and explore more 
languages and programs in the future which would hopefully be helpful in my future career.

### Future Plans
By the time I graduate in 2025:
- [ ] I plan on securing an internship by that time
- [ ] From there hopefully I get a full-time job somewhere in the tech industry

My dream job title is a **Data Analyst**
but who knows what I will be interested in by then and <sub>what job I can even secure for myself...</sub>
- [ ] I would love to become financially independent so that I can live alone and get a dog! (<sup>a pomeranian
would be a dream</sup>)
